# F12 Fires A Node Server

Press F12 on any Windows Explorer folder to fire a node server. Autohotkey + batch + node

## Installation

- `npm install @titodp/server`

## Usage

### VIA Autohotkey

- Install Autohotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com/
- Right click `server-launcher.ahk` from this package folder (usually in `%AppData%/npm/node_modules@titodp/server`) and from the submenu choose `Compile Script`. You may want to add the compiled script to your startup so after a reboot still works.

### via the command line

Just type `server` and it will serve the current directory
